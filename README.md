This webpage houses a map with water quality data collected by citizen scientists participating in the Limno Loan program. It is a demonstration webpage created for UPP 465 homework 3.

The webmap index and css codes were modelled after an in-class demonstration provided by instructor Shelley Hoover, and created using sublime text. The web map was developed via ArcGIS online (AGOL) for a previous UPP 465 assignment and embedded in this webpage using the embed code provided by AGOL.

The geographic extent of the web map is Great Lakes States, since the program I was designing this for, called Limno Loan, loans out water monitoring equipment (Hydrolab datasondes) to teachers and students in Great Lakes states. The purpose of this project is to create a platform where loanees can share their data and access data from others, in case theyâ€™d like to compare results and run analyses as part of their classroom curriculum.
